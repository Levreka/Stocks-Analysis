# Stocks-Analysis
#analysis deliverable 1: it was very difficult task and I didn’t do most of the requirements instead I try to find ways to fix bugs and things that were kind already wrong with my original module.

#Purpose of analysis: The purpose was to determine which stocks are more profitable by using the data of both 2017 and 2018. We were able to get results and see volume depending on tickers name. This information can later be used on more deeper analysis. 

##Results: it seems like I did seem to improve on the processing time a bit by fixing some of the bugs, but it was worth noticing that as I try to reconstructed and recreated the time would fluctuate from time to time specially if I had 2 or 3 excel documents open.  The following images show results from the module 1 and once I try to refracture it.

#Summary: noticeable advantages of refactoring code are you get to play with the code more and see different way or more effective methods to perform tasks. It also forces you to explore more the web, especially when you can’t make the code work and you must look for alternatives. The disadvantage of using refracturing code in a workbook you already used is that you can ruin your whole code. Several times I had to go back into my word document to copy and paste the old code that did work in order to start from scratch again. Which can really hinder you, in a light of that because of those errors now I can pinpoint my mistakes better. For example I learn a lot on referencing worksheets correctly due to the fact that most of my code would fail because of that.
